Available FPGA: 
- Altera DE2
- teasIC 28nm DE5
- Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+
- Xilinx Nexus v7
- Renting one off AWS

General recommendation is make the designs very portable and test on one of the physical devices we have.

Sorin has preference of starting assuming ASIC, but we should be prepared to switch to FPGA if needed.

Sorin wants the most interesting thing in 4 weeks. Wants interesting networks to run on swarm.
